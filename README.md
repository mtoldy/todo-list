# Todos
Welcome in README. Bellow are some tasks what we need to proceed. Can you help us with this?

* Application can't be build and properly started, could you find and fix the issues? Be sure that even in console there are no errors.
* We would like to see the actual list of the tasks on home page with possibility to mark task as completed and / or delete task. 
Hint: with correct solution the newly added tasks on Todo list page would persist on page change (Todo list page -> Home page => Todo list page)
Hint2: you can reuse existing component.
* When the task is completed, title should be striked through. Can you do it without adding new class or styles into any HTML elements except host element?
* Please do a lazy loaded 'Todo' module as we don't need it always and main js bundle could be therefore smaller.
* In todo-list.component.html is possible performance issue. Can you find it and explain why?
* Animation on list of tasks is not optimized, especially when more then 10 tasks are in list. Do you have an idea how to solve it?
* Sometimes network is slower then it should be so would be fine if during every network request is spinner visible. Use shared/components/spinner component
* Sometimes network error can occure. Can you show error in modal? You can use ng-bootsrap modal to show it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
